# NEO-MINIVIMIST

**Minimal and beautiful Neovim config!**

This is an opinionated config/dotfiles for neovim beginners. Since Neovim is
migrating most of its configuration bases to lua, you might also wanna see some
configurations that can be done with minimal plugins!

Configuration doesn't include plugins, you might want to install it using your
own plugin manager.

Inspired by projects like [doom-nvim](https://github.com/NTBBloodbath/doom-nvim)
(I'm going back and forth between emacs and nvim, and now this!),
[LunarVim](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/LunarVim),
[nvim_like_me]( https://github.com/christopher-besch/nvim_like_me ). These
project has done much to help me with understanding how lua works, especially
their codebase, so you might find some resemblance to these project, turned into
a minimal neovim config (not super minimal, but okayish), will publish the
`maximalist` version at later date once it completes.

Enjoy!
